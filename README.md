# C-Snake
Python scripts for generating C/C++ code

This project now supports generating static initializers for all kinds of variables, including arrays (multidimensional included). This is super useful for generating headers for bitmaps, fonts, statemachines, whatever.
Only thing not supported as of now are designated inits for structs, but you can use regular array initializers for structs. Designated inits are coming soon.

Refer to 'example.py' for an introduction to the script
