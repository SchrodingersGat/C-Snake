# C-Snake
Python scripts for generating C/C++ code

This project now supports generating static initializers for all kinds of variables, including arrays (multidimensional included). This is super useful for generating headers for bitmaps, fonts, statemachines, lookup tables, whatever.
Designated initializers for structs are also supported.

Refer to 'example.py' for an introduction to the script
